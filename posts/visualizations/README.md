## Visualization

### Chosen Library
- visjs-network 

### Candidate libraries

- Neovis.js (Neo4j Labs): too early
- Popoto.js: built upon d3 + direct connection to neo4j
- D3: heavy
- Vis.js: looks good / react component available
- _visjs-network_: community fork from vis.js. Dedicated to networks (graphs). Best choice so far
- Sigma.js: not evolving much
- Vivagraph.js
- Cytoscape
- GraphXR
- yFiles
- Linkurious: didn't find the source
